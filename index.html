                <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
                <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in
                    Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency, and now in the State of Tamil Nadu.
                    After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School in Ramanathapuram, Kalam
                    continued his education at Saint Joseph's College in Tiruchirappalli, which was formerly a part of
                    the University of Madras.
                    Kalam was nominated by India's ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to succeed outgoing
                    President Kocheril Raman Narayanan in 2002. Despite being Muslim, Kalam was nominated by the Hindu
                    nationalist (Hindutva) NDA, and his status and popularity were such that the Indian National
                    Congress, the main opposition party, also proposed his candidacy.Kalam easily won the election, and
                    in July 2002, he was sworn in as India's 11th president, a purely ceremonial position. He was
                    succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country's first female president.
